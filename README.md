# sway-config-scripter

A fairly useless tool I wrote for myself to define themes for [sway](https://swaywm.org).

Right now, these scripts live inside .config/sway on my machine, but they really should be elsewhere and the output (a functinal sway config file) should be copied into place so I may do that at some point.

## TODO

* copy the output config into place instead of plopping the github repo right in the sway dir.
